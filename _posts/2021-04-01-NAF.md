**Abstract**

 Motor control is a set of time-varying muscle excitations
which generate desired motions for a biomechanical system. Muscle excitations cannot be directly measured from live subjects. An alternative
approach is to estimate muscle activations using inverse motion-driven
simulation. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
method to estimate the muscle excitations in simulated biomechanical
systems. Here, we introduce a custom-made reward function which incentivizes faster point-to-point tracking of target motion. Moreover, we
deploy two new techniques, namely, episode-based hard update and dual
buffer experience replay, to avoid feedback training loops. The proposed
method is tested in four simulated 2D and 3D environments with 6 to 24
axial muscles. The results show that the models were able to learn muscle excitations for given motions after nearly 100,000 simulated steps.
Moreover, the root mean square error in point-to-point reaching of the
target across experiments was less than 1% of the length of the domain
of motion. Our reinforcement learning method is far from the conventional dynamic approaches as the muscle control is derived functionally
by a set of distributed neurons. This can open paths for neural activity
interpretation of this phenomenon.
