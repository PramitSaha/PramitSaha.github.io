<h1>About me</h1>

Hello, thanks for visiting my webpage. If you want to know a bit more about me and my research interests and experience, this is the right page for you.

My name is Pramit and I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student in the Department of Engineering Science at [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Alison Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Noble). I am working at the intersection of medical image analysis/computer vision, and deep learning with a special focus on solving challenges in Federated Learning, Semi-supervised and Self-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, Domain adaptation, and Class-imbalanced Learning. My DPhil is funded by the [VisualAI project](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/). [Here](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/pramit-saha/) is my university profile. 

I am a part of the [Oxford Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) cluster](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/) and I also work closely in collaboration with [Prof. Konstantinos Kamnitsas](https://ibme.ox.ac.uk/person/konstantinos-kamnitsas/). I am also acting as the Biomed Student Representative of the Graduate Joint Consultative Committee (GJCC) that provides a forum for discussion and negotiation between the students and staff concerning a range of matters that arise throughout the year. 

I am very passionate about teaching. I have taught (and am teaching) many undergraduate courses in the department. I am one of the Lead Tutors of the third year undergraduate courses offered by the department. Besides, I spend my weekends as a research mentor for undergraduate and pre-college students, guiding them to get started with and gain deeper understanding of machine learning topics. Some of the very fundamental works with my students can be found here and here. 

Prior to my DPhil, I received my Masters (MASc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/), Vancouver, Canada. I was a MITACS Globalink Graduate Fellow in the [Human Communication Technologies Laboratory (HCT Lab)](https://hct-lab.github.io/), supervised by Prof. Sidney Fels, where I worked on integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Deep Learning (DL) for around 3.5 years.

My Masters research particularly centered around understanding speech and neuromotor control pathway for speech production using deep learning. In the first phase of my MASc, I worked towards decoding imagined speech tokens from EEG signals and published three papers (in INTERSPEECH, ICASSP, and AAAI). Next, I moved on towards understanding speech from tongue and vocal tract movements in medical videos including Ultrasound and MRI and published two papers (in INTERSPEECH and MICCAI). My research on the development of Ultrasound-based silent speech interfaces to generate synthetic speech for individuals who had their larynx removed, was highly appreciated. Consequently, I was awarded the prestigious Young Scientist Award by MICCAI Society in 2020. I also explored different ways of controlling a Vocal Tract Model by developing various interesting physical and virtual interfaces. 
The main focus of my Master's thesis was reducing human motor control effort using deep learning while leveraging categorical perceptual constraints. 

During my master's, I also worked with Prof. Bryan Gick, the director of UBC Interdisciplinary Speech Research Lab (ISRL) and the head of Department of Linguistics, UBC as well as Prof. Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, the director of UBC Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab. Besides being a graduate research assistant, I also acted as the Treasurer and Executive Committee Member of the ECE Graduate Student Association (ECEGSA) for two consecutive terms (2018-2019 and 2019-2020).

Before joining the HCT Lab, I was a MITACS Globalink Research Intern in the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, University of Alberta, Edmonton, advised by Dr. Lawrence Le. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) degree in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, my final year project being under Prof. Amitava Chatterjee. During my junior year, I interned on the 3D Medical Image Processing area, in the Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Kgp), jointly supervised by Prof. Sudipta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Ashis Kumar Dhara. In my senior year, I worked as a research intern in the Tomography Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore) under Prof. Kasi Rajgopal.

## Research Interests

My current research primarily centers around **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning** -- with a special focus on solving challenges in decentralized training of machine learning models. My research interests include **federated learning**, **self-supervised learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **Speech Motor Control**, and **Brain-Computer Interfaces**.
